## About Me

I am a seasoned engineering leader with over a decade of experience building, mentoring, and scaling high-performing teams. My leadership philosophy is centered on creating an environment of psychological safety and empowering engineers with clear ownership. I specialize in architecting robust cloud solutions—from resilient microservices to automated infrastructure—and establishing the engineering best practices that drive efficiency and reliability.

I have a proven track record of leading complex technical migrations and modernizing legacy systems to deliver measurable business impact. I foster a culture of continuous improvement, where teams learn from challenges through blameless postmortems and data-driven decision-making to consistently refine our processes and technology.

## Key Architectural Highlights

### **Observability Platform Migration (Highspot)**

* **Challenge**: An expensive, fragmented observability stack (ELK, Grafana, Rollbar) with massive, untracked data volumes.
* **My Leadership**: I led the strategic migration to New Relic. My team developed a custom Python tool to identify and eliminate unused metrics, configured FluentBit for optimized logging, and executed a phased, dual-target migration.
* **Impact**: Achieved **$1M in annual savings**, reduced debugging time by ~15%, and provided a unified observability platform for the entire engineering organization.

### **Acquia Search Platform Modernization (Acquia)**

* **Challenge**: A legacy, fragile Solr 3 platform with manual provisioning processes that couldn't scale.
* **My Leadership**: I directed the architectural vision to modernize the platform on Solr 7 (SolrCloud). My team used AWS CloudFormation to fully automate the infrastructure lifecycle and built a self-service API, empowering customers to manage their own search infrastructure.
* **Impact**: Transformed a high-touch system into a fully automated, self-service platform, achieved **99.96% uptime**, and eliminated the support burden for provisioning tasks.

### **Asynchronous Architecture Introduction (Infoedge)**

* **Challenge**: Critical APIs were taking >60 seconds to respond due to synchronous, long-running tasks like sending emails and notifications.
* **My Leadership**: I led a team of two junior developers to introduce RabbitMQ as a core piece of infrastructure. I architected the HA cluster and designed a client library to facilitate adoption.
* **Impact**: Reduced critical API response times to **under 200ms**, dramatically improving the user experience and the overall resilience of the application.
