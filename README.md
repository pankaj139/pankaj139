### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Pankaj.

I'm an engineering leader with over a decade of experience transforming complex technical challenges into scalable, reliable, and impactful software. My passion lies in building and mentoring high-performing teams, fostering a culture of ownership, and driving technical excellence. I believe that the best products are built by empowered engineers who have the psychological safety to innovate and the clear processes to execute effectively.

My approach is hands-on and data-driven. I specialize in modernizing legacy systems, architecting resilient cloud infrastructure, and establishing the engineering best practices that enable teams to ship with speed and confidence.

## My Approach to Engineering Leadership

* **ðŸš€ Technical Excellence:** I lead from the front, architecting high-performance systems and promoting best practices like infrastructure-as-code, comprehensive observability, and robust automation.
* **ðŸŒ± Team Empowerment:** My primary goal is to grow and mentor engineers. I focus on providing clear context, unblocking challenges, and creating opportunities for my team members to take on ownership and advance their careers.
* **ðŸ“ˆ Business Impact:** I bridge the gap between technology and business goals, ensuring that every technical initiative is aligned with delivering measurable value, whether it's improving user engagement, reducing operational costs, or increasing system reliability.

## Featured Projects & Architectural Highlights

### 1. Platform Modernization & Self-Service Automation (Acquia)

* **The Challenge:** A critical, high-traffic search platform was struggling with reliability on a legacy Solr 3 architecture with fully manual infrastructure management.
* **My Leadership:** As the technical lead, I directed the architectural vision to modernize the platform on SolrCloud. My team of 10 engineers used AWS CloudFormation to fully automate the infrastructure lifecycle and built a self-service API, empowering customers to manage their own search infrastructure.
* **The Impact:** We transformed a high-touch system into a fully automated, self-service platform, achieved **99.96% uptime**, and eliminated the support burden for provisioning tasks.

### 2. Observability Platform Migration & Cost Optimization (Highspot)

* **The Challenge**: An expensive, fragmented observability stack (ELK, Grafana, Rollbar) with massive, untracked data volumes.
* **My Leadership**: I led the strategic migration to New Relic. My team developed a custom Python tool to identify and eliminate unused metrics, configured FluentBit for optimized logging, and executed a phased, dual-target migration.
* **The Impact**: Achieved **$1M in annual savings**, reduced debugging time by ~15%, and provided a unified observability platform for the entire engineering organization.

### 3. Asynchronous Architecture Introduction (Infoedge)

* **The Challenge**: Critical APIs were taking >60 seconds to respond due to synchronous, long-running tasks like sending emails and notifications.
* **My Leadership**: I led a team of two junior developers to introduce RabbitMQ as a core piece of infrastructure. I architected the HA cluster and designed a client library to facilitate adoption.
* **The Impact**: Reduced critical API response times to **under 200ms**, dramatically improving the user experience and the overall resilience of the application.
