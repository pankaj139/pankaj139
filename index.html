    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutral -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is structured into thematic sections (About, Timeline, Projects, Skills) to support both linear scanning and deep-dive exploration. A key feature is the interactive timeline where clicking a company reveals its projects. A filterable project grid allows users (recruiters) to quickly find relevant experience. This non-linear, task-oriented structure is more engaging and user-friendly for exploring a detailed career history than a simple document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Experience -> Goal: Show career progression -> Viz: Interactive vertical timeline (HTML/CSS) -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse company projects. Projects -> Goal: Allow detailed exploration -> Viz: Filterable card grid with modal pop-up (HTML/CSS/JS) -> Interaction: Click to view details, click filters to update grid. Skills -> Goal: Quick overview of technical breadth -> Viz: Grouped skill badges (HTML/CSS). NO SVG/Mermaid used. -->

                    overview: "Architected a platform-wide metadata enrichment system, enabling team-specific observability dashboards and accurate cost attribution.",
                    businessNeed: "As our platform scaled, the volume of observability data grew exponentially. A significant business challenge was our inability to attribute this data to the teams or features generating it. This created two major problems: 1) Engineering teams could not create focused, team-specific dashboards, hindering their ability to monitor their own services effectively. 2) We could not accurately forecast or attribute the substantial costs associated with our observability platform, making budgeting a challenge. The goal was to enrich all observability signals with contextual metadata (owning team, feature, action) with minimal overhead for development teams.",
                    challenges: "The primary technical challenge was to design a system that could transparently and reliably inject this metadata across a diverse, polyglot environment (Ruby, Java) and for various execution contexts, including synchronous web requests, background jobs, and other asynchronous tasks. This required a deep understanding of the application's core entry points and a solution that would not require manual instrumentation by every developer for every new feature.",
                    implementation: "I designed and led the implementation of a centralized, configuration-based enrichment system. The core of the architecture is a single, version-controlled YAML file that serves as a central registry, mapping every known action (e.g., an API endpoint route, a job class name) to its corresponding metadata. At application startup, this configuration is loaded into memory. I modified the primary entry points of our applications—creating middleware for web requests and wrappers for our job processing frameworks—to act as interception points. At the beginning of any request or job, this interception layer identifies the action being performed, looks up its metadata in the in-memory registry, and injects this context into the thread's execution context. Finally, I updated our platform's common logging and metrics libraries to automatically inspect the thread context for this metadata and attach it as attributes to every log line, metric, and trace emitted during the lifetime of that request or job.",
                    impact: "This system successfully decoupled the need for context from the implementation details. It empowered every engineering team to build their own dashboards in New Relic, filtered to their specific services and features, which significantly improved their ownership and monitoring capabilities. Financially, it provided the business with the ability to accurately attribute observability costs, leading to more informed budgeting. The rich, queryable context on all observability signals also vastly improved the debugging experience for the entire engineering organization.",

                    title: "Feature Flag System Migration to LaunchDarkly",
                    overview: "Architected and led the migration from an in-house feature flag system to LaunchDarkly, improving release safety and developer velocity.",
                    businessNeed: "Our in-house feature flagging system was a critical part of our CI/CD process but was becoming a bottleneck. It lacked advanced capabilities essential for modern release strategies, such as percentage-based rollouts, advanced user targeting, and a comprehensive audit trail. Furthermore, its ongoing maintenance was consuming valuable engineering resources. The project's goal was to migrate to a third-party solution, LaunchDarkly, to improve release safety, unlock advanced deployment strategies for our developers, and eliminate the maintenance burden.",
                    challenges: "The migration of a system so deeply integrated into the codebase and release process presented significant risks. The primary challenge was to design a seamless migration path that would not disrupt ongoing feature development or require a massive, 'big bang' refactoring effort across all teams. The solution also needed to be future-proof, allowing us to easily switch vendors again if necessary. Finally, we had to cleanse and migrate hundreds of existing feature flags, many of which were obsolete.",
                    implementation: "I architected a new, cross-platform abstraction library for both our Ruby and Java codebases. This library provided a single, standard interface for all feature flagging operations. The key to the design was a built-in fallback mechanism that allowed for a safe, phased migration. The rollout strategy was: 1) **Legacy First:** The library would first check the legacy system, with LaunchDarkly as a fallback. 2) **LaunchDarkly First:** We switched the library's priority to check LaunchDarkly first, with the legacy system as a fallback. 3) **Decommission:** Once all flags were migrated and validated, we removed the legacy system completely. I led the analysis of all existing flags and drove the effort to deprecate over 30% of them. I also wrote and executed the migration scripts to move all active flags and their variations to LaunchDarkly, including a thorough validation process.",
                    impact: "The migration empowered our development teams with advanced release capabilities, enabling safer and more controlled feature rollouts. It completely eliminated the maintenance overhead of the legacy in-house system. The abstract library design de-risked the migration and made our entire feature flagging system more maintainable and adaptable for the future.",

The goal was to consolidate onto a single platform, New Relic, to reduce costs and improve developer efficiency.",
                    challenges: "The initial discovery phase revealed a lack of documentation for existing data pipelines and a massive data volume of 18TB/day, nearly 6x our initial estimate, which would have made a direct migration prohibitively expensive. The migration required a complex technical transition across a polyglot environment, not a simple endpoint switch.",

To tackle the data volume, I developed a custom tool in Python to programmatically identify and eliminate unused and high-cardinality metrics from Prometheus. My team configured FluentBit to filter and forward logs from our services (Ruby, Java, Clojure) to New Relic. To ensure a safe transition, I executed a phased migration using a dual-target approach, sending data to both old and new systems for validation before decommissioning the legacy stack.",

However, it was built on a legacy, fragile version of Solr 3 with single-replica indexes, leading to reliability issues. Critically, all infrastructure management—from provisioning new customer clusters to resizing existing ones—was a slow, manual process requiring engineer intervention.

My team used AWS CloudFormation to automate the entire infrastructure lifecycle, treating our infrastructure as code. This made the provisioning of new clusters repeatable, reliable, and fast. I designed and led the development of a comprehensive set of internal APIs that powered a new self-service platform, allowing customers to provision, manage, and configure their own Solr collections directly via a UI or API. After evaluating the complexity of a direct data migration, we made a strategic decision to not build an automated data migration tool.
